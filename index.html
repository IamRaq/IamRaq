    Hello, world! Raq here! <br><br>

    <p>
      I am a full stack web developer specialized in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React and Node.js.  I create innovative applications 
      following the MVC paradigm, using RESTful APIâ€™s and cohesively designed user experiences. With a background in industrial engineering
      and project management, I thrive in collaborative, dynamic, and project-based environments.

      Outside of business hours, I like to DJ and work on projects related to arts and culture and community building. I am an active member 
      of the <a href="https://outintech.com/digital-corps/"> Out in Tech </a> digital corps, where I contribute to the design and development
      of web products for national and international LGBTQ+ activist organizations.
